// The following is an (incomplete) example of what a view model may look like
// The purpose of a view model is to format the incoming data from the database
// into what the ejs page requires specifically.

// For example, you may need to show a date on the ejs page like so:
// Date: Monday, Jan 14, 2021

// The default date format in javascript when you call new Date() looks completely different.
// You could solve this in the view model by changing line 19 to a string, and then having a helper
// method which converts the incoming date from the constructor (of type date) to a string formatted
// date that you store in createdAt.
